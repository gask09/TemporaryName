# Proof that I know unix, GitHub and R
This repository contains a final excercise for a *Unix and work with genomic data*, or to be more accurate, an attempt to solve problem 6 *Proportion of transitions and transversions in total and by type of nucleotide*

## Shell script
For this no additional software is required. Only thing needed is terminal. 
### (Optional) Prepare a data directory
``` bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir NameOfFile 
```
To this directory, the shell script, a R script and data file should be moved manually or via mv command:
``` bash
mv RScript.R ShellScript.sh luscinia_vars.vcf NameOfFile/
```
